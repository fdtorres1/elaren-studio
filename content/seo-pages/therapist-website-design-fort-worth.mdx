faqSectionTitle: "Common questions about therapist website design in Fort Worth"
faqs:
  - q: "How quickly can a Fort Worth therapy practice get a new website?"
    a: "About 10 days once we have your copy, photos, and access. The build itself is fast—most timeline stretch comes from content collection."
  - q: "What if I already have a website that just needs improving?"
    a: "We can audit your current site for free and give you practical recommendations. If a rebuild makes sense, we handle the full transition. If small fixes are enough, we'll tell you that too."
  - q: "Do I need to provide all the copy for my website?"
    a: "We prefer client-provided copy since you know your practice best. That said, we can help refine and structure what you provide, and copywriting support is available as an add-on."
  - q: "What's the difference between Starter and Care+ plans?"
    a: "Starter ($99/month) covers hosting, security, backups, and 1 small edit per month. Care+ ($199/month) adds unlimited small edits with 48-hour turnaround, monthly conversion tune-ups, and priority support."
  - q: "Can I switch plans later?"
    a: "Yes. You can upgrade from Starter to Care+ anytime. It's a simple plan change—no rebuild, no downtime."
