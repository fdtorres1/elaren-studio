faqSectionTitle: "Common questions from Houston practices"
faqs:
  - q: "Can my site rank for searches like 'therapist in The Heights' without building doorway pages?"
    a: "Yes. One well-structured Houston page with clear specialty and location signals outperforms a stack of thin neighborhood pages. We use proper schema markup and content structure so search engines connect your practice with the areas you actually serve."
  - q: "How should I present multiple locations or hybrid telehealth + in-person?"
    a: "Each location gets a clear section with address, hours, and parking or arrival notes. Telehealth availability should be stated plainly near every contact option—not buried in a FAQ or footer. The goal is zero ambiguity about how and where someone can see you."
  - q: "What should a contact form ask to feel safe and not invasive?"
    a: "Name, preferred contact method, and a brief note about what they're looking for. Add a short line explaining what happens next ('We'll reply within one business day'). Skip intake-level questions on the website—those come later, through your secure EHR."
  - q: "What's the difference between Starter and Care+ month to month?"
    a: "Starter ($99/mo) covers hosting, security, backups, and 1 small edit per month. Care+ ($199/mo) adds unlimited small edits with 48-hour turnaround, monthly conversion tune-ups, local SEO maintenance, and priority support. Switch anytime—no rebuild required."

<Callout bg="muted" kicker="Houston-specific" title="Neighborhood searches without doorway spam">
	<p class="text-ink/70 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
		Houston clients search by area—The Heights, Montrose, Midtown, Memorial—and by nearby suburbs like Katy, Sugar Land, The Woodlands, and Pearland. That's natural search behavior. What isn't helpful is building dozens of thin pages targeting each neighborhood with the same copy.
	</p>
	<p class="text-ink/70 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
		We structure it differently: one strong Houston hub page (you're reading it), a short "areas we serve" section naming the neighborhoods most relevant to your practice, and specialty pages based on who you help—anxiety, couples, trauma, family—that work city-wide.
	</p>
	<p class="text-ink/70 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
		One practical detail worth mentioning: if you see clients in person, include parking and arrival notes on your contact page. It sounds small, but clear directions reduce no-shows and lower the anxiety of a first visit. If you offer telehealth, clarify that option near every CTA so visitors never wonder whether they have to come in.
	</p>
	<p class="text-ink/70 mb-0 leading-relaxed">
		If you serve Spanish-speaking clients, even a dedicated "Terapia en Español" services section or a bilingual intake prompt captures searches that most Houston therapist websites miss entirely. You don't need a fully translated site to start—just a clear signal.
