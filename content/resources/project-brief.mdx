Use this template to gather what we need before starting your project. Fill in as much as you can — even rough answers help us move faster.

- **Goals** — What should the site accomplish? (e.g., generate leads, build credibility, replace an outdated site)
- **Audience** — Who is the site for? What do they need to see first?
- **Key pages** — Which pages matter most? (e.g., Home, Services, About, Contact)
- **Brand assets** — Logo, fonts, colors, any existing style guidelines
- **Examples you like** — 3–5 links to sites whose look, feel, or structure you admire
- **Timeline** — When do you need the site live?
- **Success metrics** — How will you know it's working? (e.g., more inquiries, lower bounce rate, faster load times)

Once you've filled this in, [send it our way](/contact) and we'll take it from there.
