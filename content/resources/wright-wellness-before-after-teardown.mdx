Most website redesigns are judged by aesthetics alone. But the real question is simpler: **does the new site make it easier for the right person to understand, trust, and take the next step?**

In this teardown, we compare Wright Wellness's older website with its redesigned experience and break down what improved, what still needs work, and what other service businesses can copy.

---

## Project Snapshot

**Business type:** Mental health private practice
**Primary audience:** Prospective clients looking for counseling and behavioral health support
**Main conversion action:** Request an appointment or contact the practice

---

## What We Looked At

We evaluated both versions on five conversion-critical dimensions:

- Message clarity
- Information architecture
- CTA strength and conversion path
- Accessibility and content quality
- Technical SEO basics

---

## Before: What Was Holding the Site Back

The previous homepage had an emotionally bold opening and clear intent, but it was structurally thin for conversion and SEO.

### Key issues

- **No clear H1 structure** on the page (weak semantic hierarchy)
- **Very low content depth** on homepage (limited context for search and trust-building)
- **Single-path CTA flow** that leaned heavily on "Learn more"
- **Limited section architecture** to explain services and care model
- **Accessibility hygiene gap** (missing alt text on at least one image)

### Practical impact

A visitor could sense the mission, but still leave with unanswered questions:
- What services are available?
- Why this practice specifically?
- What should I do right now?

---

## After: What Improved

The redesign made meaningful progress by turning a sparse page into a structured, scannable homepage with clearer conversion intent.

### Notable wins

- **Proper heading structure added** (H1 now present)
- **More content depth** and contextual sections
- **Stronger CTA language** (appointment-focused)
- **Improved accessibility hygiene** (image alt usage improved)
- **Cleaner trust narrative** with sections like "How we can help," "Why Wright Wellness," and "Who you'll work with"

### Practical impact

The new page reduces ambiguity and supports decision-making better. A prospect can now understand service direction faster, identify why the practice is different, and find a next step with less friction.

---

## Before vs After (Quick Scorecard)

- **Message clarity:** Improved
- **Page structure and scannability:** Improved
- **CTA conversion path:** Improved
- **Accessibility basics:** Improved
- **SEO readiness:** Improved, but not finished

---

## What Still Needs Improvement

The redesign is a strong step forward, but there are still high-leverage refinements that can compound results.

### 1) Replace generic H1 with intent-rich H1

The current H1 ("Welcome.") is friendly but weak for search intent and immediate clarity. A stronger direction: "Counseling, Medication Management & Massage Therapy in Arlington, TX" or "Compassionate Mental Health Care in Arlington, TX."

### 2) Add an FAQ block (3–5 questions)

A short FAQ can improve both conversion confidence and long-tail query coverage. This is one of the simplest SEO wins available.

### 3) Add stronger local trust signals

Location and service-area callouts, clinician credentials and specialties, and optional social proof or testimonial snippets where appropriate.

### 4) Reinforce primary CTA placement

Repeat the primary conversion action at key decision points: hero, mid-page, and footer. A single CTA at the bottom isn't enough—visitors decide at different scroll depths.

## Why This Teardown Matters for Other Service Businesses

This is a common pattern: a business has heart, mission, and expertise—but the old website under-communicates it. The redesign doesn't need to be loud. It needs to be clearer, more structured, and easier to act on.

If you run a private practice or service business, the biggest lift usually comes from clearer section hierarchy, stronger CTA architecture, and better "first 10 seconds" messaging. These are the same principles behind our [therapist website builds](/therapist-websites).

---

## Reusable Redesign Checklist

Use this on your own homepage this week:

- Is there one clear, intent-rich H1?
- Can a new visitor understand what you do in under 10 seconds?
- Do you have at least 3 trust-building sections?
- Is your primary CTA obvious and repeated?
- Is mobile reading clean and scannable?
- Do images have alt text?

If you checked fewer than 4, your site likely has conversion leakage.

---

## Final Take

The Wright Wellness redesign is a meaningful upgrade from mission-led but sparse to structured and conversion-aware. The foundation is now strong enough to iterate.

The next gains will come from **keyword-aware messaging**, **FAQ depth**, and **stronger local trust and CTA reinforcement**.
