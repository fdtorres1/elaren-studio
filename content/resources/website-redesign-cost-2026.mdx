Every year, thousands of service business owners search "how much does a website redesign cost?" and get wildly different answers. That's because "redesign" means completely different things at different price points — a template swap, a full rebuild with new copy, or a strategic overhaul with SEO migration and conversion work.

This guide cuts through the noise with real 2026 data, sourced benchmarks, and honest cost ranges. Whether you're a solo therapist refreshing a Wix site or a group practice evaluating agency proposals, you'll leave with a clear framework for what to expect and what to watch for.

## The short answer (and why the range is so wide)

For a typical local service business — roughly 5–15 pages, lead-gen focus, mobile-friendly, basic SEO — the most defensible planning range in 2026 is **$3,000–$15,000** when hiring a freelancer or small shop, and **$10,000–$35,000+** for a fuller-service agency process.

That's a wide spread. The variance comes down to scope, not quality labels. A $3,000 site with strong copy on a clean template can outperform a $20,000 site with beautiful design but weak messaging. The key is understanding what you're actually buying.

## Real cost ranges by website scope

### Single-page or landing page ($500–$3,000)

A one-page site or landing page is the simplest build. Published 2026 ranges span roughly $100–$2,000 from freelancers and $1,400–$3,200 from agencies, depending on whether copy, strategy, and testing are bundled. Expect build time under two weeks.

Best for: brand-new practices that need something live fast, or campaign-specific pages alongside an existing site.

### Standard 5–10 page brochure/lead-gen site ($2,000–$15,000)

This is the most common format for local service businesses. Multiple 2025–2026 benchmarks converge here:

- **Freelancer range:** $2,000–$8,000 (Elementor, Feb 2026)
- **Agency range:** $10,000–$35,000 (Elementor, Feb 2026)
- **Survey-based:** $3,000–$15,000 for simple 5–10 page business sites (GoodFirms, Oct 2025)

For therapy practices specifically, industry sources place solo practitioner sites at **$2,000–$5,000** and group practices at **$5,000–$15,000** (TL Design Studios, Feb 2026; Day is New Creative, Mar 2025).

### Custom strategic build, 10–20+ pages ($10,000–$35,000+)

When a service business treats its website as a core revenue tool — with conversion-focused structure, professional copy, UX research, and robust SEO — costs enter this range. These builds typically involve discovery phases, custom design systems, and multi-role delivery teams.

### Booking, payments, or light e-commerce (adds $200–$2,000+)

Any time you add payment processing, scheduling integration, or membership features, scope expands. Booking system integration alone adds $200–$500 in build cost plus $16–$99/month in subscription fees for tools like Acuity or Calendly. HIPAA-compliant form tools (relevant for therapy practices) run $39–$249/month on top of that.

### Quick comparison table

| Scope | Freelancer range | Agency range |
|---|---|---|
| Landing page (1 page) | $500–$2,000 | $1,400–$3,200 |
| Brochure/lead-gen (5–10 pages) | $2,000–$8,000 | $5,000–$15,000 |
| Custom strategic (10–20+ pages) | $5,000–$15,000 | $15,000–$35,000+ |
| E-commerce-light features | +$1,000–$5,000 | +$5,000–$15,000 |

## The 6 factors that actually determine your price

The difference between a $3,000 quote and a $25,000 quote is rarely page count. It's the depth of what's included.

### Copywriting and content

This is the single most underestimated cost driver. Professional website copy runs **$200–$1,000 per page**, with a full 5–8 page site costing **$1,500–$7,500** (AWAI Pricing Guide; ProCopywriters 2025 survey). A beautifully designed site with generic copy will underperform a simpler site with sharp, client-focused messaging.

If your provider doesn't include copy, you'll either write it yourself (expect 15–25 hours of work) or hire a copywriter separately. Either way, it's a real line item.

### Custom design depth

The jump from "template with your branding" to "custom UI/UX designed around your conversion goals" is the most aggressive cost multiplier. Templates work well for many businesses, but the ceiling is lower. If two therapy practices in the same city use the same Squarespace template, neither stands out.

### Integrations

Every tool your website needs to connect with — scheduling (SimplePractice, Jane, Acuity), CRM, payment processing, email marketing — adds scope. Therapy practices should budget for EHR integration ($49–$99/month for SimplePractice or TherapyNotes), and possibly HIPAA-compliant form tools ($39–$249/month for Formstack or JotForm).

### SEO setup and migration

Basic SEO (titles, headings, meta descriptions) should be table stakes. But if you're changing URLs, moving platforms, or restructuring your site, **SEO migration** becomes a real deliverable — redirect mapping, content preservation, post-launch monitoring. Google's documentation is explicit: URL changes need permanent server-side redirects (301/308), and mishandled migrations can cause measurable traffic loss.

Ask any provider: "What happens to my existing Google rankings during this project?" If the answer is vague, that's a red flag.

### Revision rounds and scope creep

In traditional project billing, revisions are a friction point. Agencies scope tightly, and structural changes late in the process can trigger 20–40% budget increases. One industry report notes that businesses budgeting $8,000 routinely receive $15,000 invoices when scope isn't locked early (Tenet, Dec 2025).

### Who's doing the work

Freelancers typically charge $15–$50/hour on platforms like Upwork, though this reflects a global talent marketplace. U.S. agency rates commonly land around $100–$149/hour (Clutch, Feb 2026), and the BLS reports median annual pay of $90,930 for web developers and $98,090 for web designers (May 2024). That helps explain why "professional" builds cluster in the mid-four to low-five figures.

## What your budget actually buys

### Under $1,000 — DIY territory

Template-based design on Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress.com ($16–$50/month). You handle everything — content, images, setup. Functional but generic. No conversion optimization or SEO strategy. At a therapist's $150/hour billing rate, 30 hours of DIY equals $4,500 in opportunity cost.

### $1,000–$3,000 — professional but templated

A freelancer creates a 3–5 page site with your branding, basic SEO, mobile-responsive design, and simple contact forms. Noticeably more polished than DIY. Timeline: 2–4 weeks. Limited post-launch support. You may look similar to other businesses using the same template framework.

### $3,000–$10,000 — the sweet spot for most service businesses

Semi-custom to fully custom design. 5–15 pages, strategic content planning, often with professional copywriting included, comprehensive SEO, booking integration, and conversion-focused design. Multiple revision rounds and post-launch training. This is where most successful small business redesign projects land.

### $10,000–$25,000 — fully custom, competitive markets

Completely custom from scratch. 15–50+ pages, advanced features (client portals, complex forms), comprehensive brand strategy, professional copywriting, advanced local SEO, and extensive third-party integrations. Suitable for group practices, multi-location businesses, or competitive markets.

### $25,000+ — enterprise

50+ pages, custom web applications, advanced UX research, content migration, compliance features, and ongoing optimization retainers.

## Four ways to pay for a website

### One-time project — own it outright

The traditional model. Pay a lump sum ($2,500–$10,000+ for a small business site), own the files, and host wherever you like. The site is yours. The downside: post-launch support is usually an upsell, and most owners skip it — leaving the site to stagnate.

### Monthly subscription / WaaS — low barrier, ongoing cost

Website-as-a-Service providers charge $150–$400/month with minimal or no setup fee. Examples include Oak Harbor Web Designs ($175/month, $0 down) and Brighter Vision ($100 setup + $99–$349/month, therapy-specific). The critical caveat: **in most pure WaaS models, the client doesn't own the website.** Cancel and you may lose everything. Read the terms.

### Hybrid — small upfront + monthly

A reduced launch fee paired with ongoing monthly support. This bridges the cash-flow benefit of subscriptions with more accessible pricing than a full agency build. Elaren Studio's model is an example: [$500 launch](/pricing) plus $99/month (Starter) or $199/month (Care+), bundling hosting, security, and ongoing edits.

Over 24 months, the Starter plan totals $2,876. Compare that to pure WaaS at $175/month ($4,200 over 24 months) or a one-time build at $5,000 plus $100/month maintenance ($7,400 over 24 months).

### Retainer — maintain what you already built

After a one-time project, many agencies offer $50–$400/month retainers covering updates, backups, security, and minor content edits. Annual maintenance for small business sites runs $600–$2,400/year (StateWP, Tenet, 2025–2026).

### 24-month total cost comparison

| Model | Year 1 | Year 2 (cumulative) |
|---|---|---|
| DIY (Squarespace, $33/mo avg) | $396 | $792 |
| Pure WaaS ($175/mo, $0 down) | $2,100 | $4,200 |
| Hybrid: $500 launch + $99/mo | $1,688 | $2,876 |
| Hybrid: $500 launch + $199/mo | $2,888 | $5,276 |
| One-time build ($5,000) + $100/mo maintenance | $6,200 | $7,400 |
| Agency build ($15,000) + $200/mo maintenance | $17,400 | $19,800 |

## Costs that don't show up in the quote

Published SMB guides frequently recommend budgeting an **extra 10–20%** for items that aren't always in the base price (Elementor, Feb 2026).

### Content migration, stock photos, and accessibility

Moving content from an old platform can cost $500–$5,000 depending on complexity. Professional stock photography runs $200–$500 for a small site. ADA web accessibility compliance adds $2,500–$4,000 when built into a redesign — and $5,000–$20,000 for retroactive remediation. Over 8,000 ADA web accessibility lawsuits were filed in 2024, a 7% increase from 2023 (AudioEye, 2025).

### Ongoing maintenance

A website is an actively depreciating asset without maintenance. WordPress sites are particularly vulnerable — 96% of vulnerabilities come from plugins and themes (Patchstack, 2025). Even static sites need SSL renewals, dependency updates, and content freshness.

Budget $50–$200/month for small-site maintenance, or choose a provider that bundles it.

### Third-party tools

For therapy practices, these are business costs that are inseparable from the website's function:

- **EHR/scheduling:** SimplePractice $49–$99/mo, TherapyNotes $49–$59/mo
- **HIPAA-compliant forms:** Formstack $59–$249/mo, JotForm $39–$99/mo
- **Email:** Google Workspace $6–$22/user/mo
- **Domain:** $10–$15/year
- **Premium plugins/tools:** $10–$50/month each

## Does showing your prices actually help?

The research is clear on direction: **81% of B2B buyers want to find pricing information on their own**, and **16% will eliminate vendors who don't show it** (TrustRadius, 2022, 2,185 respondents). In the 2024 follow-up, transparent pricing was named the **#1 thing buyers wish were different** about purchasing.

The nuance matters. A study of 31 million visitors across 80 B2B companies found that transparent pricing pages actually produce lower raw form-conversion rates (2.8% vs. 4.6%) — but visitors who do submit are dramatically more qualified (HockeyStack Labs, 2025). Fewer leads, better leads.

The canonical service-business example: Marcus Sheridan's single blog post about swimming pool costs generated over **$35 million in lifetime revenue** for River Pools, making it the most-trafficked pool website in the world (Pool Magazine, 2024–2025). His finding — that fewer than 10% of non-ecommerce businesses address pricing on their websites — is corroborated by a Digital Marketing Institute analysis showing only 12% of marketing service providers communicate concrete price ranges.

For web design studios and service businesses alike, transparent pricing reduces research friction, builds trust faster, and pre-qualifies leads. Companies leveraging price transparency report 27% higher conversion rates (Forrester B2B Marketing Benchmark, 2025) and 28% shorter sales cycles (HubSpot data). A Gartner survey of 632 B2B buyers found that 61% prefer a completely rep-free buying experience (Jun 2025).

If you can't publish exact prices, publish ranges, starting figures, or package tiers with scope assumptions. The worst option is making people hunt for any pricing signal at all.

## How to tell if a redesign is worth it

### The 2–3 client test

For a therapist charging $150/session and seeing clients weekly, each new long-term client represents roughly $7,200/year in revenue. Acquiring just 2–3 additional clients through an improved website pays for most redesign investments within months. The math works for most service businesses — a plumber, a law firm, a wellness practice — just adjust the average client value.

### What the ROI data actually shows

Stanford's Web Credibility Research found that **75% of consumers judge company credibility based on website design**. This is one of the most replicated findings in UX research.

Page speed matters too: a **7% drop in conversions for every 1-second delay** in page load is consistently documented across studies.

The directional finding is clear — well-designed, fast, clear websites generate measurably more leads and credibility than outdated or generic ones. The specific magnitude depends on your market, your copy, and whether your site is doing the strategic work or just looking good.

## FAQ

### How much should a small therapy practice budget for a website redesign?

Most solo therapy practices invest **$2,000–$5,000** for a professional site that generates leads. Group practices typically need **$5,000–$15,000**. This includes custom or semi-custom design, basic SEO, and mobile-responsive layout. It does not include ongoing costs like hosting, EHR integration, or content maintenance. A subscription alternative — $99–$199/month with a small launch fee — spreads the investment over time and bundles ongoing support.

### Why do two "5-page website" quotes come back at $3,000 and $25,000?

Because "5 pages" isn't the real scope. Price is driven by how many unique layouts are being designed, whether copywriting is included, what integrations must be wired, and whether the vendor is including SEO migration work and a formal launch process. Ask every vendor to itemize what's included — copy, SEO, revisions, post-launch support — so you're comparing the same scope.

### What hidden costs should I plan for?

Budget an extra 10–20% for year one. Most-missed items: professional copywriting ($1,500–$7,500 if not bundled), content migration ($500–$5,000), stock photography ($200–$500), ongoing maintenance ($600–$2,400/year), and third-party tools. ADA compliance adds $2,500–$4,000 when built into the redesign.

### Is a monthly subscription better than paying once?

It depends on cash flow and time horizon. Subscriptions spread cost and bundle maintenance, but you typically don't own the site. Over 24 months, a $500 launch + $99/month hybrid totals $2,876 — comparable to a $3,000–$5,000 one-time build plus separate maintenance. Before signing any subscription, ask: what happens if I cancel? Do I keep my content? Is there a buyout option?

### Does showing pricing on my website actually help?

The data says yes. 81% of B2B buyers want to find pricing independently, and 16% eliminate vendors who hide it. You'll get fewer leads but dramatically better-qualified ones. Marcus Sheridan's pricing transparency approach generated $35M+ in lifetime revenue for a pool company. The approach transfers to service businesses: publishing ranges or starting prices builds trust and shortens sales cycles.

### How do I protect my search rankings during a redesign?

Treat SEO migration as a paid deliverable. At minimum: map all changed URLs to permanent 301/308 redirects, preserve your top-traffic pages, and monitor Google Search Console for 60–90 days post-launch. If your provider doesn't mention redirects or URL mapping proactively, ask why.

### Will a new website actually bring in more clients?

Directionally, yes — 75% of consumers judge credibility by website design. But design without strategy is decoration. A pretty site still needs clear copy, local SEO, and visible calls to action. The biggest lift usually comes from clearer messaging, not fancier visuals.

### Can I just use Squarespace or Wix and save the money?

You can — and for some situations it's the right call. But factor in 20–40 hours of your time at your billing rate. DIY platforms lack conversion optimization, strategic copywriting, and professional SEO. If your site needs to actively generate leads (not just exist), the gap is measured in clients acquired, not dollars saved.

## What to do next

If you're evaluating a redesign, start with the scope — not the price. Define what your website needs to do (generate leads? build credibility? support booking?) and what you're willing to handle yourself (copy, photos, ongoing updates). Once scope is clear, quotes become comparable.
