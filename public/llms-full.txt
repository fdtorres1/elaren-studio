Your website is often the first impression a potential client has of your practice.

- **Make your services clear**: Help visitors understand what you offer and whether you're the right fit—without confusion.
- **Increase consult inquiries**: Better conversion flow means more of the right people actually reach out to schedule.

### What's Included

- Up to 5 core pages — Home, About, Services, Contact, and one more of your choice.
- Basic SEO setup — Title tags, meta descriptions, and local search basics.

### Process

1. **Discover** — We learn about your practice, your clients, and what makes your approach unique.
2. **Structure** — We map out the pages, content flow, and calls to action that make sense for your practice.
3. **Build** — We design and develop your site—mobile-first, fast, and conversion-focused.
4. **Launch** — Final review, your tweaks, domain connected, live to the world.

Realistic timeline: ~10-day launch target once copy, assets, and access are provided.

### FAQ

**How fast can we launch?**
Our target is ~10 days from the time we have your copy, assets, and access. Most delays come from content gathering, not our build process.

**Do you work with solo and group practices?**
Yes. We work with solo therapists, group practices, and multi-location clinics. The core build scales to fit your team size.

**Can I upgrade from Starter to Care+ later?**
Absolutely. You can upgrade anytime. It's a simple plan change—no rebuild required.

**Who writes the copy for my website?**
We prefer client-provided copy since you know your practice best. We can help refine and structure what you provide, and copywriting support is available as an add-on.

**Do you provide HIPAA compliance?**
We build websites, not medical software. We can guide you toward HIPAA-aware hosting and form handling best practices, but we do not provide legal compliance guarantees. For regulated workflows like patient intake or telehealth, we recommend working with a compliance specialist alongside our web build.

**What happens if I need changes after launch?**
On Starter, you get 1 small edit per month. On Care+, unlimited small edits with 48-hour turnaround. Larger changes are scoped separately.

**Do I own my website?**
Yes. You own the design and content. Hosting and maintenance are part of the monthly plan, but the site itself is yours.

## Therapist Website Design in Houston, TX

URL: https://elarenstudio.com/therapist-website-design-houston-tx/

Therapist Website Design for Houston Practices.

When someone in Houston searches for a therapist, they're usually already stressed. Your website is the first step they take—and it should make that step feel safe and simple. We build bright, enduring websites for therapy practices: calm design, clear navigation, and a straightforward path from visitor to consult request.

### Who This Is For in Houston

- **Solo therapists**: Launching or refreshing a private practice and need a professional site without a $5,000 agency bill.
- **Group practices**: Multiple clinicians, specialties, and locations need structure that scales—not another template.
- **Hybrid practices**: Balancing telehealth and in-person across the Houston metro with clear scheduling paths for both.
- **Teams that want easy updates**: A site you can keep current without learning code or waiting on a developer.

### Common Website Friction Points

- Unclear next step (call vs form vs consult request)
- Buried specialties (modalities and populations hidden in subpages)
- Location confusion (multiple offices, telehealth availability jumbled or missing)
- Privacy discomfort (forms feel intrusive with no expectation-setting)
- Mobile usability (tiny type, hard-to-tap buttons, slow loading)

### Houston-Specific Guidance

Houston clients search by area—The Heights, Montrose, Midtown, Memorial—and by nearby suburbs like Katy, Sugar Land, The Woodlands, and Pearland. We structure sites with one strong Houston hub page, a short "areas we serve" section, and specialty pages that work city-wide. We avoid building dozens of thin neighborhood pages.

Practical detail: include parking and arrival notes for in-person visits. For telehealth, clarify that option near every CTA. For bilingual practices, even a dedicated "Terapia en Español" section captures searches most Houston therapist sites miss.

### Houston FAQ

**Can my site rank for "therapist in The Heights" without doorway pages?**
Yes. One well-structured Houston page with clear specialty and location signals outperforms a stack of thin neighborhood pages. We use proper schema markup and content structure so search engines connect your practice with the areas you actually serve.

**How should I present multiple locations or hybrid telehealth + in-person?**
Each location gets a clear section with address, hours, and parking notes. Telehealth availability should be stated plainly near every contact option—not buried in a FAQ or footer.

**What should a contact form ask to feel safe and not invasive?**
Name, preferred contact method, and a brief note about what they're looking for. Add a short line explaining what happens next. Skip intake-level questions on the website—those come later, through your secure EHR.

**What's the difference between Starter and Care+ month to month?**
Starter ($99/mo) covers hosting, security, backups, and 1 small edit per month. Care+ ($199/mo) adds unlimited small edits with 48-hour turnaround, monthly conversion tune-ups, local SEO maintenance, and priority support. Switch anytime.

We also serve practices in Dallas, Fort Worth, and across Texas.

## Group Practice Website Design

URL: https://elarenstudio.com/group-practice-website-design/

Group Practice Website Design That Scales as Your Team Grows.

Group practices have different website needs than solo providers. You need structure that supports multiple clinicians, specialties, and inquiry paths—without overwhelming visitors.

### Built for Multi-Provider Practices

- **Provider directory structure**: Bio pages that are easy to maintain and update as clinicians join or leave the practice.
- **Clear service taxonomy**: Individual, couples, family, child/adolescent—organized so visitors find what they need fast.
- **Inquiry routing**: Clear paths so prospective clients know who to contact and how—reducing confusion and admin overhead.
- **Scalable architecture**: Page structure that grows with your team. Add clinicians and services without a redesign.

### Conversion Priorities for Group Practices

The biggest conversion challenge for groups isn't aesthetics—it's decision complexity. More providers, more services, more ways a visitor can get confused and leave.

- **Help visitors self-select quickly**: Clear navigation and positioning so people find the right provider or service without guessing.
- **Reduce drop-off with simpler decision paths**: Fewer clicks to get from "I might need help" to "here's how to reach out."
- **Make scheduling/contact options explicit**: Whether it's a form, phone number, or intake link—make it obvious and accessible from every page.
- **Keep messaging consistent across providers**: Each clinician page should feel like part of the same practice, not a disconnected profile.

### What We Deliver

- Custom design + setup
- Up to 5 core pages at launch (expandable)
- Mobile-first UX
- SEO/analytics baseline
- Provider directory structure
- Optional ongoing care plans

### Best Fit

This page is for group practices that want a clear, durable website foundation now and incremental optimization over time. Solo therapists may prefer the main therapist website page. Either way, the build process and pricing are the same—the difference is in how we structure the site architecture.
