# Structure illuminated.

Elaren Studio was founded on a simple idea: websites should be as clear and enduring as the work they represent.
We build and maintain them with the same care we bring to our own craft—steady, precise, and grounded in respect for our clients’ time.
Each project is a partnership built on clarity, not complexity.

## Team
**Felix Torres — Director**  
Felix’s approach to web design mirrors his work in music: precision, pacing, and flow.
