# Active Context

Last updated: July 29, 2026

## Current state

- This is the canonical local Elaren Studio website checkout.
- Local path: /Volumes/Felix-SSD-1/Cursor Projects/Elaren/website
- Git history and tags were cloned from the former elaren_studio_com checkout.
- Canonical remote is https://github.com/elaren-studio/website.git.
- Current production domain configured in source is https://elarenstudio.com.
- The site uses Astro 7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, MDX content collections, FormSubmit, and Plausible.
- The site presents Elaren Studio as an app studio and dev shop per D-007; therapist and local-SEO pages remain live but unlinked from navigation.
- Dependencies were fully updated on July 29, 2026, including the Astro 5-to-7 and MDX 4-to-7 majors; npm audit reports zero vulnerabilities.
- The production build currently generates 29 static pages.
- /studioregister is a Studio Register product landing page added on July 23, 2026 to support Stripe business verification; it follows the product's legal-naming boundary (An Elaren Studio product; owned and operated by Wright Torres Group, LLC; no d/b/a language) and may later grow into a fuller product site.

## Repository boundary

This repository owns website implementation and public copy. Elaren company strategy, portfolio planning, naming, and master brand-source assets are canonical in the sibling HQ repository.

## Migration boundary

- The clean clone intentionally excluded node_modules, dist, .astro, SpecStory history, test output, and generated PDF output.
- Former untracked raster logo drafts were catalogued in HQ, not added to website public assets because no website code referenced them.
- The tracked legacy zip snapshot was retired; active elaren_site_content files remain because current routes read them.
- The stale SETUP.md was retired in favor of README.md and RUNBOOK.md.

## Verified external state

- Elevated GitHub CLI authentication is active for fdtorres1.
- The public repository was transferred and renamed from fdtorres1/elaren-studio to elaren-studio/website. GitHub preserved repository ID 1092039889, history, main, environments, and the former-path redirect; fdtorres1 retains ADMIN permission.
- Local main matches origin/main; check git for the current head rather than relying on a pinned commit in this document.
- GitHub records Preview and Production environments.
- The authenticated Vercel project is felixs-projects-a5ff4c9b/elaren-studio, project ID prj_xFdQeKvaDH8l5LeD4smVEUxmM2FX.
- Vercel is connected to GitHub repository ID 1092039889 at elaren-studio/website with production branch main, Astro preset, repository-root builds, and Node.js 22.x.
- The Vercel GitHub App is installed on elaren-studio with selected-repository access limited to website.
- elarenstudio.com remains attached to the Vercel project with the intended Vercel nameservers.
- Pushes to main reliably create Ready Production deployments aliased to elarenstudio.com; the deployment history is recorded in WORKLOG.md.
- Preview deployments are protected by Vercel SSO.
- Main is not branch-protected.

## External state not yet verified

- FormSubmit account ownership
- Plausible account ownership

The repository owner, name, local origin, and Vercel Git connection changed successfully. The Vercel project, domain, DNS, form, and analytics settings did not change.

## Next actions

1. Continue running validation and a production build before pushes to main.
2. Verify FormSubmit and Plausible account ownership separately when needed.
